In a professional environment, you have two options: you can follow, or you can lead. In order to take ownership of your future, you want to spend as much time as possible leading.

It's important to understand, though, that you work in a collaborative environment. You have to be humble and open minded, and you have to work well with others. This is not about only doing what you like. It's about having a win-win mentality, where you get something and the rest of the organisation gets something as well. Otherwise, you are going to fail. Nobody wants to be around someone that's selfish and/or full of themselves.

In fact, a successful way to approach this is finding the gaps in ownership in your organisation. Those gaps are where you'll find most of the freedom of action. If you identify work that nobody wants to do, you can get (almost) total freedom while doing it. You can experiment and find a fun way to get that work done, while solving a real problem for your organisation.

It's not simple, though. The day to day inertia can get you into a vicious cycle that leaves you with no time to focus on your future. You need to be aware of this, understand when it is happening to you, and break out of it.

Remember, the end goal is to own your career, your future.

With that in mind, let's get on with it!

## Breaking the day-to-day cycle

Owning your future starts with you. This is important, no matter how obvious it sounds. You won't be able to be proactive with your goals unless you start taking action, so you need to start taking the time to invest in yourself.

Finding the time to work on your future can be difficult, though. It's really easy to fall into the trap of being constantly busy at work. If that's your problem, start by taking a good look at on what do you spend your time. As a first step, stop working on stuff that doesn't have any impact. This work usually come as useless meetings, repeatable manual work, features that aren't worth it, etc. Each organisation is different, so you need to identify this type of work in your environment.

Be strong and just stop doing it. If it causes a problem, come back to it, but most likely, it will be OK. Taking this step is going to give you back enough time to work on what matters to you.

I can't stress how important this first step is. Taking your time back is what you need as a foundation to build on. Keep checking every week, even every day, if you are wasting your time. If you are, stop it.

## Win-win thinking

Now that you have time, the next step is to start thinking about what you want to do.

Find ways where you get to do what you want to do, while making an impact in your organisation and on others.

### Look for gaps in ownership

The easiest way to have freedom to work on something, is to find a gap in ownership. If nobody owns it, you can basically do almost anything you want without any resistance. It's an opportunity to experiment and grow.

## Deliver to build trust

Deliver on your ideas. Follow through. Do what you say you are going to do.

Keep delivering and the organisation as a whole will trust you more and people will start to rely on you to guide them.

## Communicate what's coming

People want to know what's coming. Communicate frequently to avoid surprises.

## Communicate outcomes

Let the world know about what you just achieved. This helps with building trust, but also to let people know that your ideas have impact.

That's all!
