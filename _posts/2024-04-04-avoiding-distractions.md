Having a clear mission and clear goals is the first step on alignment and strategic thinking, but what happens after that is the real deal. To focus on your goals, you need to avoid distractions.

It's very easy to chase the latest trend or be blinded by that glitter opportunity. The problem is that while you are chasing those things, you are wasting time to reach your goals.

With that in mind, letâ€™s get on with it!

### What is a distraction?

Anything that moves you away from the intended course of action outlined by your strategy.

Based on that, the first step is to have a strategy! That's why defining a mission to clarify goals and objectives is a must before thinking about distractions. Otherwise, nothing is a distraction. Or better yet, everything is...

Distractions can come in various forms, such as unexpected events, competing priorities, or tempting opportunities that arise along the way. They delay progress towards strategic objectives by causing individuals or organizations to deviate from the planned path or lose focus on key priorities.

Some distractions are good, though, that's why managing distractions effectively is essential for staying aligned with the strategic direction and maximizing the chances of achieving desired outcomes.

### When is a distraction worth it?

A distraction may be considered worth it when it offers significant benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks of diverting attention from the original plan or strategy. For example, when talking about yourself, a distraction might be worth it when it provides learning and growth. It might not be related to your future goals, but it will give you new skills and change your way of thinking. In a team or organisation setting, an example might be building new relationships that improve the team morale.

You have to be careful, though. Distractions are, by default, not worth it.

### How to stay away from distractions?

You need to find your own way. Personally, those two things have helped me the most:

- Have clear goals. Having clear goals, no matter how well defined or how big or small they are, is a basic need to avoid distractions. If you don't have goals, then everything is a distraction, nothing is important.

- Get into the habit of working on your goals at least a little bit every day. This is, for me, the most important one. After setting your direction, you need to find a way to get there. Creating good habits that help you get there is key.
