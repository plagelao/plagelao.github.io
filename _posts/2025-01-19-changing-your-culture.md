Your organisation culture is not a set of values in your wall. Your actions, and your colleagues actions, define your organisation culture. It's not what you think you are, it's what you do. It's not a list of values, it's the repeating actions.

Repetition defines culture. The little traditions are what your culture is about. If your teams are always firefighting, you have a fire-fighting culture. You might not like it, it might not reflect what you want to project, but that's what it is. If you spend your days in meetings, your have an over-meeting culture.

You need to actively work on your day to day actions to actively define your culture. Talking about what you want is not enough, you need to act on it. In fact, acting on it should be the starting point, the speech should come later.

And you have to be consistent. You have to make your culture a set of traditions. Things that you have been doing for a long time that are just the way things are. This implies that cultural change is difficult and time consuming by definition. **In order to change your culture, you have to create a new tradition, abandon an old one, or both**.

I need to talk about the danger zone, maybe? It's the part where you are getting bored of repeating the message, but you ahve to do it because you need more buy-in. This is a critical moment, and you need to have the system to take you to the end of this difficult part, when you have enough traction so you don't need to be always "selling".

The danger zone is where you are most likely to abandon your change before people are used to it, making it unsuccessful. It's difficult because you have been at it for a while and you haven't seen a big change yet, so it is easy to get demoralised.

That's where your system can help you. Having a good system that prevents you from abandoning the change before you should can help you to get out of the danger zone.

If you behave like an asshole, you will be part of a toxic culture.

If you spend part of your working hours learning and studying, you will be part of a continuous learning culture.

With that in mind, let's get on with it!

Once you start asking yourself what went well and what didn't, you are going to have a clear understanding on how to improve. Now you need to implement the changes effectively, you have to change your culture.

Your culture is a reflection of your actions and behaviours, which means that you need to start by doing, not by telling. Writing down how you want the organisation or team culture to be is not going to help. You need to take action.

And you also need to be aware of the challenge. Culture has inertia and it's not easy to change it. You have to focus on the quick wins first, to start showing change. If you try to change everything at once, you will fail.

So, how do you start?

### Find one good habit to replace the old one

You have identified something that you want to change. For that change to be effective, you need to find something to replace what you are doing now. This is the most critical part of the process, because it's how you are defining your new culture.

For example, imagine that you have notice that you have a lot of meetings. All those meetings are interrupting your flow and others, and they are not leaving enough time in your day for focus work. Some things you can try are canceling all the meetings in your calendar, or declaring a meeting-free day every week. While those ideas might seems interesting and easy to achieve, they lack substance. People won't stop having meetings just because you say so, and if they can't have meetings on a Friday, they will have them on a Monday. Those type of changes won't drive a cultural change, which makes them less likely to stick.

A different way to approach the problem of change, is by finding an alternative.

Instead of the shallow ideas from before, you can take a stand, and declare that your end goal is to make the organisation more asynchronous. Asynchronous organisation move their focus from meetings to documentation, which gives you a place to start.

Now that you have a strategy for the change, your next step is to start to act on it.

For the meetings example, you can start by getting into the habit of, once a day, instead of setting up a meeting, you just write an email about it. Or even better, a page in your documentation platform, to start a discussion there. This action moves your organisation from where you were to where you want to be.

### One step at a time

Step by step, you'll be more comfortable with the new habit.

When you feel that it has became natural to you, you can increase it to replacing two meetings instead of one. With time, you'll reach your goal. You will have less meetings and you will have changed your organisation culture.

Sometimes, the small change you are implementing might not work. That's why you want to focus on small steps, because if you are not getting what you want from it, you can just abandon it and think about something else.

### Blameless culture

Mistakes are normal, we're still human beings.
Things are going to fail.
Remove blame when you fail, because you will. Just get up and do it again.
