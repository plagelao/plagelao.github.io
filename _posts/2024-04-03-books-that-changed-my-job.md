The book that can help you the most to put this in practice is 'The seven habits of highly effective people'. It's a great book, but you have to read it when you are ready. I wasn't ready the first time I tried to read it. I had to walk a long walk, and come back to it to finally "get it". My walk took me from personal development books, to management books, with a lot of technical books in the middle, until I got into the right mindset.

If you are interested in the journey from my first try to read the seven habits book to finally enjoy reading it, those are the books I remember, in reading order:

- The chimp paradox (I didn't like it much)
- Thinking fast and slow (Great book)
- Why Iâ€™m No Longer Talking to White People About Race (Great book)
- How To Be An Antiracist (Great book)
- The black swan (Great book)
- Noise (Good book)
- The courage to be dislike (OK book)
- The managers path (Good book)
- Become an effective software engineering manager (Good book)
- Radical Candor(Good book)
- Surrounded by idiots (OK book)
- The seven habits of highly effective people (Great book)

\*I haven't added any of the technical books, that needs another article
