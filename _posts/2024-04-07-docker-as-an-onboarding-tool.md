Having an easy onboarding experience is crucial for a team as it facilitates faster integration of new members, increases productivity, boosts morale, enhances retention rates, and improves team dynamics. By providing clear guidance and resources, teams can ensure that new hires quickly become familiar with the team's culture, processes, and tools, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to projects from the outset. This fosters a sense of belonging and engagement among new hires, reduces turnover, and strengthens working relationships within the team, ultimately contributing to overall team success.

### Summary

Docker simplifies the process of setting up and managing development environments, making it easier for teams to onboard new team members and get them up to speed quickly. It also ensures consistency for the team, making it easier for members to switch projects without having to deal with complex local configurations.
