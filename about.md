Hey there! I'm a software developer and manager, and I must say, I absolutely love my job! Coding is amazing. I do it every day, and it's always fun. Solving new problems and adding cool features brings me lots of joy!

I've also discovered that I really like managing people. It's a whole different aspect of the job, but the feeling I get when my team successfully releases major projects is just as rewarding as when I'm coding.

As a developer, I handle coding with expertise, and as a manager, I lead the team effectively. It's a perfect balance. Both roles challenge me and contribute to my personal growth. Being able to switch between coding and managing keeps things fresh and allows me to experience the best of both worlds.

It's an exciting ride, do you want to come along?
